# Scala Models Code

### NOTES

* The repo shoud be organized so we can all keep our scala code in the DS2_P1/scala/scalaTion_reg_models/src/main/scala/models/ directory. So just create a new .scale file in there and work out of that directory.

* To correctly start the metals server: cd into the "scalaTion_reg_models" directory and run the command "sbt". If you are working in VS Code this should start it up for you.
