# CSCI X360: Data Science 2 - Project 1

## Group Number: 2

## Group Members:
* Spencer King
* Chandler Harris
* Nikhil Jindia
* Tango Nham


## Project Goal

The goal of the project was to model 6 datasets with 2 different coding languages (Scala and Python) with the following models: 

1. Regression
1. Ridge Regression
1. Lasso Regression
1. Quadratic X Regression
1. Symbolic Regression
1. Symbolic Ridge Regression
1. Symbolic Lasso Regression

## Project Organization

The project organized into 4 main folders: raw_data, cleaned_data, python, and scala. The raw_data folder is filled with the original datasets as they came from the original sources. The cleaned_data folder is filled with a formatted and cleaned version of the origional data. The python folder holds all of the Python code, and in that folder there should be a README_py.md file that outlines how to run all Python code. Finally, the scala folder holds all of the Scala code and ScalaTion packages, and in that folder there should be a README_scala.md with more specific instructions on how to run the Scala code. 

Under the main directory DS2_P1 there is also a results.xlsx, results_summary.doc, and a results_summary.pdf. These files outline the results from each of the models on each data set and then summarize them in a meaningful way.
